# Operations

## Description

Flashbots is looking for someone to support crew operations. You should have experience dealing with all administrative tasks required to scale a startup including financial, legal, and human resources. Given the irregular nature of our organization, you are expected to be able to find creative solutions where best practices fail to meet our requirements.

## Flashbots

Flashbots is a research and development organization formed to mitigate the negative externalities and existential risks posed by miner-extractable value (MEV) to smart-contract blockchains, starting with Ethereum. We are not your typical startup, our principles are based on that of a [pirate hacker collective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0fAznO1wA8).

If you are a self-reliant, self-directed individual who puts collective success above your own and are motivated by solving hard problems with asymmetic impact and opportunities, you will fit right in.
